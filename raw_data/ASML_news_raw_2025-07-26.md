        "description": "Person looking at a computer screen with folded hands.\n\n## ASML's cloudy 2026 guidance is weighing on the stock\n\nASML's latest quarterly numbers ticked all the right boxes. The company reported a 24% increase in revenue from the year-ago period, while its earnings shot up by 47%. Its numbers were well ahead of consensus expectations. The Dutch company received new orders worth 5.5 billion euros during the quarter, well ahead of the Wall Street estimate of 4.8 billion euros. [...] However, the stock's performance has been quite disappointing in the past year. ASML stock has lost 18% of its value during this period. The company's latest results for the second quarter of 2025 added to investors' misery. ASML stock fell more than 8% following release of the company's Q2 report on July 16.\n\nLet's see why that was the case and find out if this semiconductor stock's poor performance in the past year is an opportunity for savvy investors to buy a potential long-term winner. [...] It is trading at 26 times earnings right now, which is a discount to the  average earnings multiple of 51 for the U.S. technology sector. The company's growth has been solid of late, as its latest quarterly results tell us, and the prospects of the semiconductor equipment market could help it sustain that momentum in the long run as well.",
