ASML stock has lost 18% of its value during this period. The company's latest results for the second quarter of 2025 added to investors' misery. ASML stock fell more than 8% following release of the company's Q2 report on July 16.\n\nLet's see why that was the case and find out if this semiconductor stock's poor performance in the past year is an opportunity for savvy investors to buy a potential long-term winner. [...] However, ASML's Q3 guidance of 7.4 billion euros to 7.9 billion euros in revenue was lower than analysts' expectations of 8.2 billion euros. Investors were also alarmed by the company's 2026 outlook. Though it is expecting a 15% increase in revenue this year, CEO Christophe Fouquet remarked that while the company is preparing \"for growth in 2026, we cannot confirm it at this stage.\"",
